JumpGame (also known as DogFly!?) is a simple Flappy Bird like game. I don't remember what inspired me to make the game. It is currently unfinished but it is in a playable state.

The game can downloaded and played at [https://dudex.itch.io/jump-game](https://dudex.itch.io/jump-game).

This project is built with Godot 3.6+.
